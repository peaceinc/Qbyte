## Qbyte.py
Data Visualization for Qbyte Processing

Steps to run locally:

1. Clone this directory onto your local machine
2. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Configure your desired settings at the top of 'QByte.py'. The comments explain what each setting is.
4. Run 'QByte.py' from the command line as follows:

python QByte.py mode remarks

MODE: This can be 'static' or 'auto'. The only difference between the two is that the 'auto' mode will automatically switch views every 10 minutes.

REMARKS: This is an easy way to remember your session. You can input anything without spaces.
  
Examples:

python QByte.py static BirthdayParty

python QByte.py auto FamilyGathering
  
As you run a session, two files are produced that are timestamped with the initialization. The one labeled '*_C.txt' contains any comments you entered, and the other contains the raw data.

## QBread.py

To re-analyze the raw data from a prior session, run 'QBread.py' as follows:

python QBread.py input_file
  
Example:

python QBread.py QB_1630886880_BirthdayParty.txt
